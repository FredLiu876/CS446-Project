This is our CS446 project, WatPool, a carpooling app for people to meet, cut costs as both a driver or a passenger, and save the planet. 

WatPool is a native android app designed to facilitate carpooling among daily commuters and students. 

The app connects people who need a ride with drivers that take pre-scheduled trips.

**For prof and TAs:**
We as a team underestimated our time logs, we only logged the time we spent on actual coding and not the time we spent on research, debugging, and collaborating through Discord. So our total time may come in under the suggested requirement but we all spent a substantial amount of time on this project. Thank you for your understanding!
