This is our CS446 project, WatPool, a carpooling app for people to meet, cut costs as both a driver or a passenger, and save the planet. 

WatPool is a native android app designed to facilitate carpooling among daily commuters and students. 

The app connects people who need a ride with drivers that take pre-scheduled trips.
